# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 
    Our team will meet on a weekly basis on Thursdays at 4pm for around 1hr. We will either meet through
    Discord or via Zoom. Following the group meeting we will post a meeting recap in the discord. We can
    adjust our meeting length based on the weekly work load necessary.


2. **Assistance** 
Teammates may contact each other through discord. Teammates should be able to respond the same day unless the text is sent late.  If a teammate has an emergency they should contact the other teammmates if possible to let them know they will not be available.  

3. **Respect** 
Teammates should strive to communicate effecitively.  They should try to express feedback without being rude and criticism should be constructive.  Teammates should try to not talk over eachother and ensure everyone has a chance to present ideas.  If a teammate feels they are not being heard they should tell the other teammates and they should listen and try to resolve the conflict.

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
    We will assign work based on each members prior experience and expertise. If there is a more difficult
    task we can work as a group to complete it. Each member can work on smaller tasks individually and share
    their work during the weekly group meetings so everyone is on the same page. If a certain member is unable
    to complete their set work in a given period of time, we will reristribute the work load accordingly.

5. **Time Commitment** 
    The time commitment per week will be about 2-4 hrs on average. If there are any new conflicts or
    commitments we will make sure to communicate this to all group members 24 hrs before a deadline.

6. **Conflict Resolution** 
If a conflict arises between team members the team should first try to resolve it themselves.  The first step to solving a conflict is for someone to bring it to the attention of the team.  Then, each member should be given a chance to talk about their perspective without interuption if they wish.  After this the team will discuss and agree on a solution that works for everyone. If the situation is not resolved after this the team should seek out help solving the conflict from course staff.
